## Employee Attrition Prediction using ANNs

Employee attrition is the gradual reduction in employee numbers. Employee attrition happens when the size of your workforce diminishes over time. This means that employees are leaving faster than they are hired

Companies spend 15-20% of the employee's salary to recruit a new candidate

It takes 52 days on average to fill a position.

This project aims to predict Employee Attrition using Artificial Neural Networks
